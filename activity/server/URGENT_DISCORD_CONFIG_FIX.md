# üö® URGENT DISCORD CONFIGURATION FIX üö®

## IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

Your Discord Activity is failing authentication because the Discord Developer Portal configuration is incorrect. Follow these steps RIGHT NOW:

## Step 1: Discord Developer Portal Settings

1. Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications/1388207626944249856
2. Login with your Discord account

### OAuth2 Settings (CRITICAL)
1. Go to "OAuth2" section
2. **Add these EXACT redirect URIs:**
   ```
   https://api.opure.uk/api/auth/callback
   https://www.opure.uk
   https://opure.uk
   ```

3. **Set these EXACT scopes:**
   ```
   ‚òëÔ∏è identify
   ‚òëÔ∏è rpc
   ‚òëÔ∏è rpc.activities.write
   ‚òëÔ∏è rpc.voice.read
   ```

### Activities Settings (CRITICAL)
1. Go to "Activities" section
2. **Activity URL Target URL Origin:** `https://www.opure.uk`
3. **Activity Test URL:** `https://www.opure.uk`
4. **Activity Shelf URL:** `https://www.opure.uk`

### General Information
1. **Application ID:** `1388207626944249856` (confirmed)
2. **Public Key:** Make sure this is set

## Step 2: Environment Variables Check

Your API server needs these environment variables in Vercel:

```bash
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=1388207626944249856
DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET=[your-client-secret]
DISCORD_REDIRECT_URI=https://api.opure.uk/api/auth/callback
```

## Step 3: Test the Fix

1. After updating Discord settings, wait 2-3 minutes for propagation
2. Launch Activity from Discord voice channel 
3. Check browser console for authentication logs
4. Look for "Discord authenticate() successful" message

## Expected Success Flow:

```
üîê Starting Discord Activity authentication...
üîê STEP 1: Using Discord Activity authenticate() method...
‚úÖ Discord authenticate() successful: [user data]
üë§ Setting authenticated user from authenticate(): [username] ID: [user_id]
üéâ Discord Activity authentication completed successfully!
```

## If Still Failing:

1. Check Discord Activity is properly approved/published
2. Verify Activity is launched from voice channel (not direct browser)
3. Ensure user has permission to use Activities in the server
4. Check Activity is enabled in server settings

## Critical Success Indicators:

- Real Discord user ID (17+ digits)
- Real Discord username (not "DiscordUser" or "ActivityUser")
- No "permission error" messages
- Authentication completes in STEP 1 (authenticate() method)

## DEPLOY THIS FIX IMMEDIATELY

After updating Discord settings, the authentication should work within 2-3 minutes.
