# 7. APPLY PATCHES TO EXISTING CODE
"""
To apply these patches to your existing music_cog.py:

1. Change line ~2184:
   FROM: next_song_data = await asyncio.wait_for(self.queue.get(), timeout=900.0)
   TO:   next_song_data = await asyncio.wait_for(self.queue.get(), timeout=3600.0)

2. Around line 2335-2343, modify the auto-leave condition:
   FROM: should_auto_leave = (self.queue.empty() and not self.loop and ...)
   TO:   should_auto_leave = False  # Disable auto-leave

3. Replace the voice state update method with enhanced_voice_state_update

4. Add the improved_reconnect_logic method to MusicInstance class

5. Add error_recovery and keep_alive methods to MusicInstance class

6. In the player loop, wrap playback in try-except with error recovery
