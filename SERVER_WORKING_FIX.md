# 🎉 **SERVER IS WORKING - FINAL OAUTH2 FIX**

## ✅ **GREAT NEWS: SERVER IS DEPLOYED AND RESPONDING!**

I just tested your server:
- ✅ `https://api.opure.uk/health` → Working perfectly
- ✅ `https://api.opure.uk/api/auth/discord` → Working correctly

**Your authentication UI is beautiful and the server is responding!**

## 🔍 **THE REAL ISSUE: BROWSER CORS OR ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES**

Since the server is working, the "Failed to fetch" error is likely:

### **Issue 1: Missing Discord Client Secret**
The server can't exchange the OAuth2 code without the Discord Client Secret.

### **Issue 2: CORS Configuration**
The server might not be configured to accept requests from Discord Activity context.

## 🔧 **IMMEDIATE FIX: CHECK VERCEL ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES**

### **Step 1: Check Current Environment Variables**

**Go to your Vercel Dashboard:**
1. Find your api.opure.uk project
2. Settings → Environment Variables
3. **Verify these are set:**

```
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID = 1388207626944249856
DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET = [MUST_BE_SET_FROM_DISCORD_PORTAL]
DISCORD_REDIRECT_URI = https://api.opure.uk/api/auth/discord
CLIENT_URL = https://opure.uk
ALLOWED_ORIGINS = https://discord.com,https://ptb.discord.com,https://canary.discord.com,https://opure.uk
NODE_ENV = production
```

### **Step 2: Get Discord Client Secret (CRITICAL)**

**If `DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET` is missing or wrong:**

1. **Go to**: https://discord.com/developers/applications/1388207626944249856
2. **Click "OAuth2"** in left sidebar  
3. **Copy the "Client Secret"** (click Copy button)
4. **Add to Vercel** as environment variable `DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET`
5. **Redeploy**: Go to Vercel → Deployments → Click "..." → Redeploy

## 🧪 **TEST IN BROWSER CONSOLE**

**To debug the exact error:**

1. **Open Discord Activity** (showing your beautiful auth screen)
2. **Press F12** → Console tab
3. **Click "Authenticate with Discord"**
4. **Look for error messages** in console

**Common errors you might see:**

### **"CORS error"**
**Fix**: Add `CLIENT_URL=https://opure.uk` to Vercel environment variables

### **"Invalid client_secret"**  
**Fix**: Add correct `DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET` to Vercel environment variables

### **"Network error"**
**Fix**: Check if Discord is blocking the request (try different network)

## 🔄 **QUICK TEST: MANUAL OAUTH2 FLOW**

**Test the OAuth2 endpoint directly:**

```javascript
// Run this in browser console on your auth page
fetch('https://api.opure.uk/api/auth/discord', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ code: 'test_code' })
})
.then(r => r.json())
.then(console.log)
.catch(console.error)
```

**Expected response**: `{"success":false,"error":"Invalid authorization code"}`
**If you get CORS error**: Environment variables need to be set

## 🎯 **MOST LIKELY SOLUTION**

Since your server is working and your UI is perfect, the issue is probably:

### **Missing Discord Client Secret**

**Quick fix:**
1. **Copy Client Secret** from Discord Developer Portal
2. **Add to Vercel** environment variables  
3. **Redeploy** (Vercel → Deployments → Redeploy)
4. **Test Discord Activity** again
